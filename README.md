# Personal-website
Personal Website I developed with HTML,CSS Javascript and Python.  I used the django framework to develop this website which allowed a fast development time using the base template to expolate the code to other pages.Also, I used a CDN to allow a typewriter on the homepage.  This website was deployed by heroku and the database used is Postgresql
